            <strong>How it works:</strong> This application uses modern web technologies to compress
            your files directly in your browser. We use Web Workers to process files in the
            background without affecting your browsing experience.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>No data collection:</strong> We don't collect any information about your files
            or usage. There are no analytics, tracking, or cookies used in this application.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Temporary storage:</strong> Your files are temporarily stored in your browser's
            memory during processing and are automatically cleared when you close the application or
            navigate away.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Secure processing:</strong> All processing happens in an isolated environment
            within your browser, ensuring your data remains secure throughout the compression
            process.
