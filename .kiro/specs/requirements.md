# File Compressor - Requirements Specification

## Functional Requirements

### Core Compression Features
- **Image Compression**: Support JPEG, PNG, WebP formats with quality control
- **Video Compression**: Support MP4, WebM formats with bitrate control
- **Quality Settings**: Default (60%) and custom (0-100%) compression levels
- **Batch Processing**: Handle multiple files simultaneously
- **Real-time Progress**: Show compression progress with cancellation option

### File Support
- **Image Formats**: JPEG (.jpg, .jpeg), PNG (.png), WebP (.webp)
- **Video Formats**: MP4 (.mp4), WebM (.webm), AVI (.avi), MOV (.mov)
- **File Size Limits**: Handle files up to browser memory limits
- **Validation**: File type and size validation before processing

### User Interface
- **Drag & Drop**: Intuitive file upload interface
- **Theme Support**: Light and dark mode with system preference detection
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Accessibility**: WCAG AA compliance with keyboard navigation
- **Progress Indicators**: Real-time feedback during processing

### Download & Results
- **Individual Downloads**: Download compressed files one by one
- **Batch Downloads**: Download all compressed files as ZIP
- **Statistics Display**: Show original vs compressed file sizes
- **Comparison Metrics**: Display compression ratio and time taken

## Technical Requirements

### Browser Compatibility
- **Primary Support**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari 14.1+, Edge
- **Fallback Support**: Older browsers with library-based compression
- **Feature Detection**: Automatic detection of browser capabilities
- **Graceful Degradation**: Fallback methods when native APIs unavailable

### Performance Requirements
- **Memory Management**: Efficient handling of large files
- **Processing Speed**: Reasonable compression times for typical files
- **Resource Cleanup**: Proper cleanup of Canvas contexts and object URLs
- **Concurrent Processing**: Limit concurrent operations to prevent browser freeze

### Security & Privacy
- **Client-side Only**: All processing happens locally in browser
- **No Server Uploads**: Files never leave user's device
- **Secure Processing**: Network monitoring to prevent external requests
- **Memory Safety**: Secure handling of file data in memory

### Quality Standards
- **Code Quality**: TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier for consistent code
- **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive unit, integration, and E2E tests
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling with user-friendly messages
- **Documentation**: Clear code documentation and user guides

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Usability
- **Intuitive Interface**: Easy to understand without instructions
- **Fast Loading**: Quick initial load with lazy-loaded components
- **Clear Feedback**: Obvious success/error states and progress indication
- **Consistent Design**: Uniform styling across all components

### Reliability
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of compression failures
- **Browser Crashes**: Prevent browser crashes from large files
- **Fallback Systems**: Multiple compression methods for reliability
- **Data Integrity**: Ensure compressed files are not corrupted

### Maintainability
- **Clean Architecture**: Separation of concerns with clear component boundaries
- **Modular Design**: Reusable components and services
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage for better maintainability
- **Testing**: Automated tests for all critical functionality

### Scalability
- **File Size Handling**: Support for increasingly large files
- **Batch Processing**: Efficient handling of multiple files
- **Memory Optimization**: Prevent memory leaks and excessive usage
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track and optimize compression performance

## Constraints

### Technical Constraints
- **Browser APIs**: Limited by available browser APIs (Canvas, MediaRecorder)
- **Memory Limits**: Constrained by browser memory allocation
- **File Format Support**: Limited to formats supported by browser APIs
- **Processing Power**: Client-side processing limited by device capabilities

### Business Constraints
- **Privacy First**: No server-side processing allowed
- **Open Source**: Must use open-source libraries and tools
- **No External Dependencies**: Primary methods should not rely on external services
- **Cross-platform**: Must work across different operating systems

## Success Criteria

### User Experience
- Users can compress files without technical knowledge
- Compression completes in reasonable time for typical files
- Clear indication of compression results and savings
- Smooth experience across different devices and browsers

### Technical Performance
- 97%+ test pass rate maintained
- Memory usage stays within reasonable limits
- No browser crashes or freezes during processing
- Consistent compression quality across different file types

### Quality Metrics
- Code coverage above 90%
- No critical accessibility violations
- Fast loading times (< 3 seconds initial load)
- Reliable compression results across browser types
