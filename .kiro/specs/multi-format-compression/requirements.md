# Multi-Format File Compression - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature expands the existing file compressor web application to support additional file formats beyond images and videos. The goal is to add compression capabilities for documents (PDF, ODT, PPT, DOC, XLS), audio files (MP3, WAV), application files (APK), and additional image formats (TIFF) while maintaining the current app's architecture, privacy-first approach, and user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Document Format Support

**User Story:** As a user, I want to compress document files (PDF, ODT, PPT, DOC, XLS) to reduce their file size for easier sharing and storage, so that I can manage my documents more efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads a PDF file THEN the system SHALL compress it using client-side PDF processing libraries
2. WHEN a user uploads ODT, PPT, DOC, or XLS files THEN the system SHALL compress them using appropriate document processing methods
3. WHEN document compression is complete THEN the system SHALL maintain document integrity and readability
4. WHEN document compression fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and fallback options
5. IF a document contains embedded media THEN the system SHALL compress the media components separately
6. WHEN processing large documents THEN the system SHALL show progress indicators and allow cancellation

### Requirement 2: Audio Format Support

**User Story:** As a user, I want to compress audio files (MP3, WAV) to reduce their file size while maintaining acceptable audio quality, so that I can store and share audio files more efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads an MP3 file THEN the system SHALL compress it by adjusting bitrate and quality settings
2. WHEN a user uploads a WAV file THEN the system SHALL compress it using audio compression algorithms
3. WHEN audio compression is applied THEN the system SHALL provide quality control options (bitrate, sample rate)
4. WHEN audio compression is complete THEN the system SHALL maintain audio playability across browsers
5. IF audio compression fails THEN the system SHALL provide fallback compression methods
6. WHEN processing large audio files THEN the system SHALL use streaming compression to manage memory

### Requirement 3: Application File Support

**User Story:** As a user, I want to compress APK files to reduce their download size, so that I can distribute Android applications more efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads an APK file THEN the system SHALL compress it using ZIP-based compression methods
2. WHEN APK compression is applied THEN the system SHALL preserve the APK structure and signature validity
3. WHEN APK compression is complete THEN the system SHALL verify the compressed APK maintains its functionality
4. IF APK compression would break the application THEN the system SHALL warn the user and offer alternative compression levels
5. WHEN processing APK files THEN the system SHALL handle embedded resources and assets appropriately

### Requirement 4: Extended Image Format Support

**User Story:** As a user, I want to compress TIFF images using the same interface as other image formats, so that I can manage all my image files consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads a TIFF file THEN the system SHALL compress it using the existing image compression pipeline
2. WHEN TIFF compression is applied THEN the system SHALL preserve image quality and metadata as configured
3. WHEN TIFF compression is complete THEN the system SHALL offer conversion to other formats (JPEG, PNG, WebP)
4. IF TIFF contains multiple layers or pages THEN the system SHALL handle them appropriately
5. WHEN processing large TIFF files THEN the system SHALL use memory-efficient processing methods

### Requirement 5: Unified Compression Interface

**User Story:** As a user, I want to use the same familiar interface for all file types, so that I don't need to learn different workflows for different formats.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads any supported file type THEN the system SHALL detect the format automatically
2. WHEN different file types are uploaded together THEN the system SHALL process them in a unified queue
3. WHEN compression settings are adjusted THEN the system SHALL show relevant options for each file type
4. WHEN batch processing multiple formats THEN the system SHALL handle each format with its appropriate compression method
5. IF unsupported file types are uploaded THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback about supported formats

### Requirement 6: Format-Specific Quality Controls

**User Story:** As a developer, I want format-specific compression controls so that users can optimize compression for their specific use case.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN compressing documents THEN the system SHALL offer compression level options (low, medium, high)
2. WHEN compressing audio files THEN the system SHALL provide bitrate and quality controls
3. WHEN compressing APK files THEN the system SHALL offer compression level with safety warnings
4. WHEN compressing TIFF files THEN the system SHALL provide the same controls as other image formats
5. WHEN switching between file types THEN the system SHALL update the UI to show relevant controls

### Requirement 7: Browser Compatibility and Fallbacks

**User Story:** As a user on different browsers, I want the compression to work reliably regardless of my browser's capabilities, so that I can use the tool consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN native browser APIs are available THEN the system SHALL use them for optimal performance
2. WHEN native APIs are not supported THEN the system SHALL fall back to JavaScript libraries
3. WHEN WebAssembly is supported THEN the system SHALL use WASM-based compression for better performance
4. IF WebAssembly is not supported THEN the system SHALL use pure JavaScript implementations
5. WHEN browser capabilities are detected THEN the system SHALL inform users of available features

### Requirement 8: Memory Management for Large Files

**User Story:** As a user processing large files, I want the application to handle memory efficiently so that my browser doesn't crash or become unresponsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing large files THEN the system SHALL use streaming compression where possible
2. WHEN memory usage is high THEN the system SHALL implement chunked processing
3. WHEN multiple large files are queued THEN the system SHALL limit concurrent processing
4. IF memory limits are approached THEN the system SHALL warn users and suggest alternatives
5. WHEN compression is complete THEN the system SHALL clean up all temporary resources

### Requirement 9: Privacy and Security Maintenance

**User Story:** As a privacy-conscious user, I want all new file formats to be processed locally without any data leaving my device, so that my sensitive documents remain private.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any file format is processed THEN the system SHALL perform all operations client-side only
2. WHEN compression libraries are loaded THEN the system SHALL verify they don't make external requests
3. WHEN processing sensitive documents THEN the system SHALL ensure no data is cached externally
4. IF network requests are detected THEN the system SHALL block them and alert the user
5. WHEN compression is complete THEN the system SHALL securely dispose of all temporary data

### Requirement 10: Performance and User Experience

**User Story:** As a user, I want the expanded format support to maintain the same fast, responsive experience as the current image and video compression, so that the tool remains efficient to use.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new formats are added THEN the system SHALL maintain current loading performance
2. WHEN processing different file types THEN the system SHALL provide consistent progress feedback
3. WHEN compression is complete THEN the system SHALL show the same detailed statistics for all formats
4. IF compression takes longer than expected THEN the system SHALL provide time estimates and cancellation options
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide format-specific troubleshooting guidance
